It’s official, we’ve entered Fall, and alongside the nostalgia of fuzzy socks and hot cocoa by a fire, many of you are
thinking of selling your home in the winter months. While it's true that homeowners often believe that the colder months
might not be the right time to sell, that isn’t entirely true. Selling your home in the winter months can be just as
fruitful. In fact, selling your home in the winter months also allows you the opportunity to stage your home while
embracing the spirit of the holidays. Everything from a festive and tasteful wreath on your front door, to your
fireplace burning during a showing, there are so many holiday-inspired ways that can increase buyer interest in your
home while tapping into that same nostalgia as the fuzzy socks and hot cocoa.  
First things first, when it comes to selling your home in the winter months you want to be sure you are creating a sense
of cozy and warm. Ever heard of hygge? According
to [HGTV](https://www.hgtv.com/design/design-blog/design/heres-to-hygge-the-cozy-danish-lifestyle), they recommend
leaning into that Danish principle when selling your home in the winter months writing, “Well, the secret's finally out.
If you've ever wondered how those Scandinavian countries with long, cold winters manage to be the happiest nations in
the world, we have an answer for you. It's called hygge. Pronounced ‘hoo-gah,’ this Danish expression is an attitude
towards life that emphasizes finding joy in everyday moments. Rather than drudge through the winter, hygge is about
celebrating coziness, warmth.” So how exactly can you emphasize your home’s winter hygge to appeal to potential buyers?
Here are a few of [HGTV’s](https://www.hgtv.com/design/design-blog/design/heres-to-hygge-the-cozy-danish-lifestyle)
recommendations:

### **Soft Tones & Natural Textures Sell in The Winter Months**

Soften the textures and colors in your space. Think creamy whites and soft tones. Consider a festive table runner on
your dinning room table in soft winter blue or white! Also, let any natural wood shine. Wood can inspire feelings of
being closer to nature and a sense of calm in your space. Maybe some wooden logs in the fireplace?

### **Declutter and Deep Clean to Sell**

Clear off your space by removing any clutter and making sure everything is organized. Using woven baskets or bins can
help with organization and add a decorative element!

### **Light Up Your Home When Selling in the Winter Months**

Candles can go a long
way, [HGTV](https://www.hgtv.com/design/design-blog/design/heres-to-hygge-the-cozy-danish-lifestyle) experts say,
“Evoking a cozy atmosphere is key to enduring the colder months. Create your own by trading fluorescent lights for
scented candles. They'll fill your home with a gentle glow and a pleasant aroma.” Consider some festive natural pine or
warm apple scents!

### **Celebrate Seasonal Favorites when Selling in Winter**

Thinking of having a beverage served during
showings? [HGTV](https://www.hgtv.com/design/design-blog/design/heres-to-hygge-the-cozy-danish-lifestyle) recommends,
“Keep the winter blues at bay with a drink that warms you from within. A steaming cup of hot chocolate, freshly-brewed
coffee, or tea.” Don’t forget, there really isn’t anything more festive than a cup of warm apple cider!
