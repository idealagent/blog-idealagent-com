## **1\. The Grass is Greener** 

Start with the lawn when you’re looking for curb appeal landscaping ideas. A lush, vibrant lawn is the cornerstone of curb appeal. As the canvas for your property's overall appearance, a well-maintained lawn can greatly improve your home's look. And it doesn't require professional landscaping services! You can significantly enhance your lawn's appearance on a budget with a few basic care steps. Let's go over some tenets of basic lawn care:  

- **Regular Mowing:** Keeping your grass at an ideal height encourages healthy growth and helps prevent weeds. Mow regularly, but avoid cutting more than 1/3 of the grass blade at once.  
- **Water Wisely:** Lawns typically need about an inch of water per week, including any rainfall. It's best to water early in the morning to minimize evaporation.  
- **Fertilizing:** Use a slow-release fertilizer to nourish your lawn. Fertilize in early spring and late fall for the best results.

## **2\. Light it Up**

Need curb appeal ideas for your front yard? Lighting plays a pivotal role in your home's curb appeal. Not only does it allow viewers a good view of your home after nightfall, but it's also an important security feature. You can even dramatically highlight parts of your home's architecture with the proper lighting and placement. Let's talk about a few simple ways to upgrade your lighting for a curb appeal boost:  

- **Select the right fixtures.** Consider fixtures that enhance your home's architecture. If your budget allows, invest in energy-efficient LED options with longevity and cost savings. Remember to be consistent and choose fixtures with a similar style and finish.  
- **Placement is key.** Strategic placement of outdoor lighting can dramatically change the appearance of your home. Focus on illuminating pathways, landscaping features, and anything else you want to stand out. Use spotlights to highlight trees or interesting textures on the exterior of your home.  
- **Try some DIY.** If you’re looking for affordable curb appeal ideas, consider refreshing your existing lights with a coat of outdoor paint or warm LED bulbs. 

## **3\. Driveway Makeover** 

Your driveway is more than just a path for your vehicles; it's also an element of your home's curb appeal! Over time, they can become stained, cracked, and worn, detracting from your home's appearance. But with a few driveway curb appeal ideas, you can have your driveway looking new again in no time.  

- **Driveway Cleaning:** Start by removing any weeds growing in cracks or along the edges of the drive. Use a weed killer if needed. For surface stains from oil or grease, apply a degreaser or a homemade solution of dish soap and warm water. Scrub the stains with a stiff brush, then rinse thoroughly with a hose. A power washer can be a valuable tool for tougher stains to remove years of grime.  
- **Driveway Repairs:** Small cracks and holes can become more prominent if left to grow. Clean out any dirt or debris from these areas and use a concrete repair caulk or asphalt patch to smooth the surface. Be sure to let any repairs set before driving over them.  
- **Sealant:** After your repairs and cleaning, you can apply a driveway sealant to protect from future damage and add an appealing sheen to the surface.

## 4\. **Front Door Updates** 

Your front door has a significant impact on your curb appeal. It may even be the most important update you can make. To refresh an existing front door, start with a simple coat of paint. Choose a color that complements the rest of your home decor, but that makes a statement. Be sure to clean the door and remove any old paint before beginning with a coat of primer.  

You can add decorations to your front port and entryway to reflect the seasons and your personal style. Wreaths, welcome mats, and potted plants are all simple additions that can make a big impact. Another simple change is your door's hardware. Replace outdated knobs, handles, and knockers with modern ones that match your home's style. You may even consider getting new house numbers to update the look.

## **5\. Clean, Clean, Clean**

Even the best curb appeal ideas go unnoticed if your house appears dirty or messy. Dirt, grime, and cobwebs detract from your curb appeal but are easy to fix. Regular cleaning will help improve your curb appeal _and_ preserve your home's condition for longer. Cleaning is the ultimate in cheap curb appeal ideas since you likely already have most of the supplies needed. 

- **Windows:** Sparkling windows can transform your home into a brighter and more inviting space. Start by dusting off the frames and sills. Use a solution of vinegar and water or a commercial window cleaner for a streak-free clean. Use a squeegee with an extension pole, or hire a window cleaning service for higher windows.  
- **Sidewalk and Siding:** Siding and sidewalks can attract dirt and mildew over time. If you have a pressure washer, this is a great time to use it. (Just be sure to use it on a low setting for your siding.) If not, use a brush and gentle detergent to buff out stains.  
- **Set a Schedule:** A regular cleaning and maintenance schedule will make curb appeal improvements easier when needed. Plan to clean windows at least twice a year and siding annually. Keeping up with these inexpensive curb appeal ideas can save you time and money in the long run.
