Pick your favorite films and send out your invites, this is your guide to hosting the ultimate holiday movie night at home! Here’s what you’ll need:

### **Holiday PJ Attire**

### **Snack Station**

You can’t host the ultimate movie night at home without an epic snack station. Set up a designated buffet-style table where your guests can build their own bag of goodies before the movie starts. As far as snacks go, popcorn is a must, [HGTV](https://www.hgtv.com/lifestyle/entertaining/host-a-holiday-movie-night-pictures) suggests that you “Swap the artificial butter for fun new flavors, like peanut butter caramel and bacon-cheddar.” Maybe even some sweet caramel apple popcorn? Several grocery stores sell unique premade popcorn flavors, but you can also find recipes to make at home. Next up is candy, set out bowls of assorted candies your guests can either mix with their popcorn, like a movie-themed trail mix, or eat separately. To add an extra special touch, you can get themed goodie bags, from cute Christmas trees to snowflakes printed on each bag, the festive options are endless!

### **Signature Drink Bar**

From some fresh apple cider or hot chocolate for the kids to a signature drink for the adults, adding a drink bar makes your movie night at home all the more special. [HGTV](https://www.hgtv.com/lifestyle/entertaining/host-a-holiday-movie-night-pictures) says, **“**For the adults at your gathering, a signature cocktail is a must.” They go on to describe a drink called “The Grinch” that includes champaign, ginger ale, bitters, and mint. A quick holiday drink search on Pinterest is sure to provide plenty of awesome drink recipes you could offer to your guests. Tip: make sure all the drinks are labeled so guests know which ones to grab or pour!

### Keep Things Cozy

Make sure to have plenty of blankets and pillows around for guests to use while watching the movie. [HGTV](https://www.hgtv.com/lifestyle/entertaining/host-a-holiday-movie-night-pictures) suggests that you “Let guests cozy up during movie time. Place baskets of throws around the room, and deck out the sofa with comfy throw pillows. Need extra seating? Large floor pillows give some guests soft front-row seats.”

### Holiday Bingo

Add an extra element of fun to your night by playing holiday bingo! [HGTV](https://www.hgtv.com/lifestyle/entertaining/host-a-holiday-movie-night-pictures) suggests, “Keep guests engaged with a holiday movie bingo. Decide when to start, what movie(s) will be playing during, the rules, and prizes before the party. When guests have their beverages and snacks and are ready to play, hand them handmade holiday movie-themed bingo cards, designate a judge and begin playing! Regular bingo rules apply: The first guest to cross off items straight across or diagonally wins a prize (or just glory!).” Just like the pj’s prize, winners can win hot cocoa mix, cookie mix, or even a holiday blanket or candle.
