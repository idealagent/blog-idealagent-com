You may have heard the term comparative market analysis report, or even the acronym CMA when discussing the early stages
of selling a home, but what exactly is it and how do you get your hands on one? According
to [Mass.gov](https://www.mass.gov/service-details/re62rc10-comparative-market-analysis-cma) “A CMA is an unbiased
estimate or opinion of the market value of real property by a real estate licensee who is not a licensed or certified
appraiser. The valuation techniques used are similar to the three approaches to value employed by a licensed or
certified appraiser.”

While that was a perfect definition, we thought we’d break it down a little further. Think of a comparative market
analysis report like a trusty industry tool used to measure a competitive selling price for your home. One of the most
important steps in the home selling process is making sure that you have a strong listing price. Understanding what
other homes like yours are selling for matters. In fact, a
recent [NOLO](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/how-comparative-market-analysis-helps-sellers-price-their-home.html)
article states, “Setting the right price from the start is among the most important steps toward successfully selling
your home. This requires taking a close look at what other houses are selling for, so as to judge the relative value of
your property. No matter how priceless your remodeled kitchen or finished basement are to you, the market sets a
value—the price a buyer is willing to pay. One of the key ways to compare your house to others on the market is to look
at or create a comparative market analysis, or CMA.”

A well-compiled comparative market analysis report will provide you with a clear understanding of these:

- How much homes like yours are actually selling for, taking into account size, any amenities, location, etc.- How long
