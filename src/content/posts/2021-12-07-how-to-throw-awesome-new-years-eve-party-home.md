Although we are big fans of the classic red and green aesthetic of a traditional Christmas party, nothing beats the glitz and glam of a New Year’s Eve event! Whether you are having a small get-together at home or a bash for all of your friends and family, decorating your home to ring in the new year is always a blast. Here’s the 411 on how to throw an awesome New Year’s Eve party:  

### ****Determine The Type of Event You Will Host****

Are you inviting friends and family over for an indoor sit-down dinner? Will you be doing appetizers and drinks a little later in the evening? Perhaps hosting an outdoor event? Make sure you have a clear understanding of where your guests will spend their time, so you know what rooms, tables, etc. you need to focus on. Here are a few examples:  
  
**For a Sit-Down Meal:**  You want to be sure that you have matching silverware and dining sets. Even if you choose to use paper plates to make tidying up a bit easier (who doesn’t!) you can choose to layer smaller plates on larger plates and use folded napkins as décor. Don’t forget to find a festive table runner and fresh greens or flowers to decorate your table. Setting the table before your guests arrive and adding name cards is a great way to keep your event organized.  
  
**For Indoor Appetizers and Drinks:** Scrap the folded napkins and formal place settings, instead, you can start building out appetizer stations that are designated sweet and salty. Ever thought of setting up a donut bar with all kinds of toppings? These types of stations are always a hit, with adults and kids alike! As for drinks, setting out pitchers of pre-made “signature drinks” is always a good call. You can make several of these and label them with festive names and let your guests know what is in each!

### ****Pick a Color Scheme****

So, you’ve determined the type of event you want to host, but what should the décor look like? That is where the color scheme comes into play. Are you opting for pastel pink, gold, and silver? Gold, black, forest green, and ivory? Maybe something a bit more classic like black, metals, and white? Choosing a color scheme allows you to navigate a coherent look throughout your home making your space look effortless and tasteful! Needing a little color inspo? A quick “New Year’s Eve color scheme” or “New Year’s Eve Party décor” search on [Pinterest](http://www.pinterest.com) is just the ticket! The ideas and inspiration are endless.   

### ****Set Up a Photo Booth & Game Station****

Want to make sure your event is memorable? Setting up a photo booth at home is one way to do just that. Choose a section of your home that can be the designated “studio wall” you can choose to hang colored streamers, create a balloon arch, put up signs and string lights, provide an array of fun props for your guests to use, etc. In fact, here is what [The Knot](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-make-a-photo-booth) advises, “The vibe of your DIY photo booth should be the very opposite of prom-style ‘stand here, pose, and smile’ pics. That's where props come in. Costumes, sunglasses, toys, hats, masks, paper speech bubbles and anything else your creative mind can imagine can help guests let loose and get silly. If you're not the crafty type, a computer, printer, some precut dowel rods, and glue or tape will be your best friends. Purchase downloadable photo booth prop designs (Etsy has lots!) to print out and stick to dowel rods. It's really that easy.” Don’t forget to bring a polaroid! Having the ability to print your photos on the spot and give them to your guests as party favors is definitely memorable!  
Next up, games. From card games to board games, having a few games accessible and easily displayed makes it easy for your guests to get their teams ready and start on the fun! Don’t have any games on hand? You can find tons of great game ideas for purchase at your local  
[Target](https://www.target.com/), [Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/), or even online at [Amazon](https://amazon.com)!

### **Resolutions & 2021 Recap Just Before Midnight**

Having your loved ones near is always great but reflecting on the year together makes for a perfect way to close out the night and start your New Year’s countdown. Ask your guests to gather around the table or in your outdoor patio space and go around the group describing what you are most grateful for, your favorite 2021 memory, and what you are looking forward to in the new year. Make sure you time this just right so everyone can grab some sparkling cider for the official 5…4…3…2…1!
