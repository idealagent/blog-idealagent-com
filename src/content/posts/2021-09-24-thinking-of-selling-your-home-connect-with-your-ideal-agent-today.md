If you’ve been thinking of selling your home, you certainly aren’t alone. We’ve worked with thousands of sellers from all over the United States and connected them with their **[IDEAL AGENT®](https://idealagent.com/)**. We thought we’d let them share their success stories with you to help you get from thinking of selling your home to meeting your **[IDEAL AGENT®](https://idealagent.com/)**. 

Our recent home seller, Allen, said “**[IDEAL AGENT®](https://idealagent.com/)** was terrific for the sale of our condo in Tucker, Georgia. In less than 35 days we closed the sale at full price. Within a couple of hours of calling **[IDEAL AGENT®](https://idealagent.com/)**, our Client Concierge put us in touch with a top agent. And she was terrific! Our agent met us at the condo the same day we contacted her, and the lockbox was on the door within hours. The listing process was completed within 3 days, on the internet with great pictures and an attractive description. **Best of all, we received a full-price offer within 5 days!** Real estate transactions these days are more complicated, and our sale was unique (second home, fully furnished, not at the location, etc.). But our agent walked us through all the steps with no problems. She was always available by phone/text/email and forwarded documents as soon as they were ready for signature. Our agent is a great agent, and we recommend her to anyone who is selling real estate in the Atlanta area.” It’s always great reading reviews like Allen’s and hearing how his **[IDEAL AGENT®](https://idealagent.com/)** was able to successfully help a seller just like you through the process of thinking of selling your home to actually getting it sold. However, the good reviews certainly don’t end there. 

Randolph contacted us recently and already sold his home! In fact, he says his only regret is that he wishes he had another home to sell with us. That made us chuckle! Here’s what Randolph wrote, “My agent and his staff went above and beyond in selling my home. If you’re in the market to buy or sell a home, it’s worth giving **[IDEAL AGENT®](https://idealagent.com/)** a good look prior to listing or getting another real estate agent. **The service I received was far and above what other realtors even offered.** I know the market is hot right now, and real estate agents everywhere are anxious to get your listing, but **[IDEAL AGENT®](https://idealagent.com/)** treated me excellent and kept me abreast of everything concerning my property, and had an arsenal of people to stage, repair, or fix my issues. A real plus for me as I live out of town. **My only regret is, I wish I had another home to sell.**” 

Just like Randolph and Allen, Joan had nothing but great things to say about her time working with our agents. She wrote, “**[IDEAL AGENT®](https://idealagent.com/)** is certainly ideal for selling your property. Prior to calling **[IDEAL AGENT®](https://idealagent.com/)**, I had had 4 different agencies over an 8-year period list my property. They were only interested in listing, not selling. The only people who came to see the property were brought by other agencies. All that changed when I called **[IDEAL AGENT®](https://idealagent.com/)**. The agents they recommended were the best I have ever met. Ten days after listing the property it was sold. The support and follow-up during the process were outstanding. **I highly recommend [IDEAL AGENT®](https://idealagent.com/) to the whole world.**”

When you are thinking of selling your home, you might feel a little overwhelmed with the process or unsure how and when to start. When you work with us, we can help you through the process with ease. Just like we did with Karen, another client that received exceptional service from her **[IDEAL AGENT®](https://idealagent.com/).** Not only did Karen sell her home but purchased a new one! Karen raves, “My agent did an amazing job selling our house and finding us a new one. She gave us valuable help in negotiating both sales. **We had a buyer the day the listing was posted, and she had the purchase agreement for our new house a few days later.** She also referred us to an excellent mortgage lender who got us a great rate and terms. The entire process was quick and easy.”
