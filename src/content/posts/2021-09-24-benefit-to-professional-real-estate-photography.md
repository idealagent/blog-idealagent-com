If we could say this louder, we would, the answer is a resounding, YES! Professional real estate photography has quickly become an essential element of a successful home sale. Let’s face it, in 2021 most buyers are searching the web for potential purchases. You want to be sure that your home takes the best possible photos to attract the best buyers, that is precisely when professional real estate photography comes in handy. In today’s market it’s all about first impressions. You want to be sure that your home is capturing the eye of a buyer right away otherwise, you may not get them to give you a second look.

A recent study by the [National Association of REALTORS®](https://bhgrealestateblog.com/34-tips-to-prepare-a-home-for-professional-photography/) found that “89% of homebuyers who shop online notice photos first when looking for a home.” Similarly [photographRGV](https://www.photographrgv.com/the-benefits-of-professional-real-estate-photography/) noted, “More than 80% of today’s house-hunters use the internet to research properties, and these prospective buyers rank photography as the most important tool in searching for a home online. (non-professional) cameras are often incapable of capturing the true nature of a property. Spacious rooms become small, dark and uninviting; windows with jaw-dropping views become walls of white light; stunning architecture warps into strange and unappealing angles. Great photography can draw a buyer in. Bad photography can turn them away. A professional photographer has the skill to show a property at its very best. Our passion is to ensure these spaces look as beautiful in print as they do in real life.”

There’s no denying that professional real estate photography can help your home make the best possible first impression to potential buyers. When you don’t focus on good photography you may be missing out on potential buyers, and many times getting a second look at your listing isn’t really possible. Once the seller decides on your listing, there isn’t much you can do to change their minds. Instead of having to backtrack, your best bet is enlisting the help of a photographer who can provide you with first class professional real estate photography.
