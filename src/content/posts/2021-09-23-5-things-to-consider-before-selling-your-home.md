Are you ready to roll up your sleeves and [start the home selling process](https://signup.idealagent.com/)? Before you can hammer down that yard sign there are a few key considerations to wrinkle out. Here are 5 of the most important: 

1\. **[Find the Right Agent](https://idealagent.com/):** According to an excellent article written by [Dummies®](https://www.dummies.com/personal-finance/real-estate/home-buying/10-things-to-consider-when-selling-your-house/), “When most people are ready to sell their houses, they enlist the services of a real estate agent. Good agents can be worth their commission if they know how to prepare the property for sale, market it, and get it sold for top dollar…the more you sell the property for, the more you net from the sale. Given how much homes actually cost (and how much they cost to sell and buy), you owe it to yourself to have a good agent representing you in the sale of your house.” Before selling your home for top dollar, matching with the right agent is incredibly important. 

2\. **Review a Comparative Market Analysis:** If you aren’t familiar with a CMA, you’ll want to read this. According to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/taramastroeni/2019/12/19/what-is-a-comparative-market-analysis-and-how-you-can-use-one-to-help-sell-your-home/?sh=3ecaea5a118f), **“**A CMA helps sell properties by providing guidance for the list price. Truth be told, choosing the correct list price is one of the best things that sellers can do to attract interested buyers.” If you are working with a great agent, like our agent partners, they will prepare a CMA showing recent and comparable home sales in your neighborhood so you can get a good understanding of your ultimate listing price before selling your home in order to have your home sold for maximum profit!

3\. **Determine the Right Fixes and Upgrades Needed to Sell Your Home:** Not sure if you should upgrade a few outdated aspects of your home before listing the property? Believe it or not, a few fixes here and there can really make a difference. A recent [HGTV](https://www.hgtv.com/design/decorating/design-101/10-best-kept-secrets-for-selling-your-home) article says, “Do updates that will pay off and get you top dollar. Get a new fresh coat of paint on the walls. Clean the curtains or go buy some inexpensive new ones. Replace door handles, cabinet hardware, make sure closet doors are on track, fix leaky faucets and clean the grout.”

4\. **Take Professional Photography and Videography:** Professional photos of both the indoors and outdoors will undoubtedly make a huge difference when it comes to buyer interest. Also, according to [HGTV](https://www.hgtv.com/design/decorating/design-101/10-best-kept-secrets-for-selling-your-home), “No matter how good the interior of your home looks, buyers have already judged your home before they walk through the door. You never have a second chance to make a first impression.” Before selling your home, it is important to consider what a potential buyer is seeing prior to walking through the front doors. Having professional photography and/or videography of the outside of your home can make a considerable difference in buyer interest. 

5\. **Consider Your Next Property Purchase:** It’s always important to know what your plan is after selling your home. Are you moving to accommodate a growing family? Considering downsizing after your kids have flown the coop? Or are you just wanting to move to a new state or part of town? If you find the right agent to sell your home, they will most certainly be able to help with this side of the equation as well.
