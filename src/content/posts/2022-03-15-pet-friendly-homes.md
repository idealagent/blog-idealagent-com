From the start of the pandemic, our furry counterparts have taken up even more room in our hearts and homes. In fact, according to [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/09/why-millennials-are-so-obsessed-with-dogs/619489/), in 2020 there was a massive uptick in pet adoptions for adults ages 40 years and younger—aka, millennials. Leash or cat tower in tow, millennials quickly became fur parents looking for spaces to accommodate their fuzzy additions. From a larger backyard or an extra room to house a litter area and toys, millennials have been in the market for pet-friendly homes and the need is only growing.

If you haven’t already checked out our [boomers vs. millennials article](https://blog.idealagent.com/millennials-vs-boomers-home-buying-features/), now might be a good time to take a look to better understand how millennials have quickly become the most saturated demographic of homebuyers. When you couple that with the information that a recent [REALTOR®](https://magazine.realtor/daily-news/2021/07/29/consumers-are-moving-for-their-pets) survey found like, “70% of American households share a home with at least one pet” it’s clear to see why pet-friendly homes have become a hot commodity and how sellers should be aware of that rising need.  
  
Believe it or not, the need for a pet-friendly home has even caused some pet owners to move out of their current homes and find a space their pets are more comfortable in. In fact, that same [REALTOR®](https://magazine.realtor/daily-news/2021/07/29/consumers-are-moving-for-their-pets) survey concluded that “Americans are willing to move to better accommodate their pet…according to a survey conducted last year by the National Association of REALTORS® on pets' involvement in the home buying and selling process. In a REALTOR® survey of 2,000 consumers conducted last year, 68% of pet owners said they would pass on the perfect home if it didn’t meet their pet’s needs—even amid tight housing inventories. Pet owners favored homes with large yards and outdoor space as well as a garage, dog run, and large square footage for their pets.” So how does this translate for sellers? Simple, pet-friendly staging and a few home improvement projects that inspire a potential buyer to envision your home as the perfect space for their family, including those with tails!

[HGTV](https://www.hgtv.com/lifestyle/real-estate/sell-your-home-by-promoting-it-as-pet-friendly) had some really helpful tips for sellers looking to get top dollar for their homes. Here’s what they had to say, “when it comes to selling a house that might sit on the market for a while, one of the best ways to attract a different breed of buyer is to appeal to those who plan to share the home with their best friends: the four-legged kind, that is. Pet owners are bonded to other pet owners, so it’s a real selling tool if you show that your home is good for pets. Almost any home can be marketed to pet owners and if you take a little extra time to highlight the pet-friendly aspects of your house, it just might sell more quickly.”  
Wondering what small fixes or larger scale additions you can make to your home to make it appear more dog friendly? These are some suggestions inspired by [HGTV](https://www.hgtv.com/lifestyle/real-estate/sell-your-home-by-promoting-it-as-pet-friendly):  
·         During an open house, hang a leash on a coat rack or place a glass jar of dog biscuits on your kitchen countertop to give the potential owners some pet-friendly perspective.  
·         Purchase an inexpensive dog bed and have it in the master bedroom by the foot of your bed or in the living room.  
·         Instead of coffee table books, consider setting out a dog or cat magazine.  
·         Let your Ideal Agent know that you are okay with potential buyers coming to view your home with their furry friend. Setting out a water bowl at the front of the house for a buyer’s dog can go a long way to make them feel comfortable and consider making your space their own.  
·         Post photos of your dog or family pets around the house.  
·         Having a fence is always a draw-in for buyers. By extension, an electric fence is considered a major bonus and something many potential homeowners with pets are willing to pay extra for.  
·         A pet bath in the bathroom or garage is also very popular nowadays.  
  
We think these are all pretty PAW-some additions and enhancements to any home. Which will you opt for when you are ready to sell?
