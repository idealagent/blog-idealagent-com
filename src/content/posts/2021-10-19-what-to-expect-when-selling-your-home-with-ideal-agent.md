### What Our Clients Say About Selling Their Home

“My **IDEAL AGENT®** knows, NM real estate! My agent is very knowledgeable about real estate in the Las Cruces area; this was important to me since I live in another state. He advised a price point for my mother's condo and within 3 days there was a bidding "war." The sale price ended up being several thousand dollars higher than asking. Throughout this process, he stayed in contact and answered any questions within an hour... no sitting around wondering what was going on! He was great and I heartily recommend using **IDEAL AGENT®**; I would definitely use them again!” – Kristin from New Mexico  
   
“No longer a skeptic! At first, I was skeptical about **[IDEAL AGENT®](https://idealagent.com/)**. The question is, "Why would top agents work on less commission?" The answer is that they can list and sell many more homes and get more referrals. **[IDEAL AGENT®](https://idealagent.com/)** connected me with a top agent in Greater Cleveland. Within 24 hours I met the team. My agent outlined the process, explained the contract, toured my home, made a few suggestions which I completed. My home went "coming soon" on the day I wanted, then "live" on the day I wanted. I was working on a tight timeline because I had already committed to buying a home in my new location. Because my home was promoted so well, I had an offer above asking in less than 24 hours and we closed in less than 30 days. I highly recommend **[IDEAL AGENT®](https://idealagent.com/)**. They will not only save you money but you will be connected to a top agent in your area. I am no longer a skeptic.” – Charles from Ohio  
   
“Best Process EVER! This whole experience with **[IDEAL AGENT®](https://idealagent.com/)** has been great!! We like to call our **[IDEAL AGENT®](https://idealagent.com/)** our hero!!

### **Our Clients Highly Recommend Selling Your Home with Our Help**

“Highly recommended. Our experience with **IDEAL AGENT®** in selling our home was, as promised, a smooth and efficient process flawlessly managed by a top local agent. Our agent was professional and very knowledgeable, moving the process forward so that once the video tour and specifics about the property were listed, we had accepted one of 5 over-asking offers within 48 hours. Though we were living in a neighboring state, communication between us was excellent. Once the due diligence/home inspection was completed, our agent made sure the plumbing issues were resolved to both parties' satisfaction. Customer service throughout was outstanding, there were never any delays or surprises, and the 2% commission which caught our attention initially, meant we saved several thousand dollars. Also worth mentioning is the excellent service received from our Client Concierge, who first contacted us, then put us in touch with our agent. He checked in regularly for status updates and to provide some oversight. We will definitely use **[IDEAL AGENT®](https://idealagent.com/)** again in purchasing our next home and would highly recommend it to anyone considering buying or selling their property.” – Irene from North Carolina  
   
“I am very happy with my agent. She did a great job. I had a floor problem. I told her I would put $5000 aside to repair it. She said great! But said let’s wait on that offer. I got my price. Without having to fix the floor. Her escrow company was so helpful. I live overseas. Wasn’t sure how I could sell my home not being there. Can’t say enough how happy we are.” – Richard from California  
   
“Our realtor was AMAZING!!! We give him a 10/10! Selling our home was a great experience, he worked with us to understand what we wanted and helped us along every step! We will be using **IDEAL AGENT®** on our next journey!  We will be buying our next home soon!! Thank you to all the staff in **[IDEAL AGENT®](https://idealagent.com/)** for making it easy for us!” – Mario from Florida  
   
“**[IDEAL AGENT®](https://idealagent.com/)** was a great experience, the local agent who was assigned to us did a fantastic job. On her advice, we listed the house for 25,000 more than we had in mind, and it sold in one day! We also saved money on the commission.” – Michael from Florida  
   
“Fantastic experience selling our home!!! With the current 'seller's market’, we decided to sell our home of 34 years. After contacting several well-known companies, all requiring 6% commission, we saw an advertisement for **[IDEAL AGENT®](https://idealagent.com/)**. We called their toll-free number and within minutes received a return phone call. She introduced herself as a Client Concierge with **[IDEAL AGENT®](https://idealagent.com/)**. From that moment through the sale of our property our Client Concierge was actively communicating with us and checking on the status of the sale of our property. She frequently inquired how we felt our agent was doing to which we always replied excellently. **[IDEAL AGENT®](https://idealagent.com/)** matching us with our agent was an excellent pairing. Our agent provided the needed experience, support staff, and guidance for our needs. We sold our home within two weeks of going live with our listing. We couldn't be happier with the efforts, professionalism, and dedication to the sale of our home.” – David from Pennsylvania

### **The Reviews that Highlight What to Expect**

“Would you please add my name to the long list of satisfied sellers who have used **IDEAL AGENT®’s** nationwide referral service? As an out-of-state seller, **IDEAL AGENT®** referred me to one of Virginia's top-rated realtors, to sell my condominium in Forest, VA. My agent’s knowledge and experience in today's real estate market, relative to negotiating complex and multiple buyers' offers, exceeded my expectations. Not only in terms of the sales contract but also in handling all of the necessary and complex real estate transactions seamlessly.” – Jean from Virginia  
   
“**[IDEAL AGENT®](https://idealagent.com/)** to the rescue! I had a duplex for sale in Spanish Fork Utah and had a bad experience with an agent that thought that my property was worth much less than what I wanted. After a month of spinning my wheels, I let the guy go. Put the phone down, said a little prayer, and **[IDEAL AGENT®](https://idealagent.com/)** came on TV. Best call I could have made, they lined me up with an agent who called me the same day. Zillow estimate was $100,000 low and we were able to fix that. Short story we sold two weeks after listing and profited over $300,000 on the property. Best agent service ever.” – Marc from Utah

“**[IDEAL AGENT®](https://idealagent.com/)** was great to work with. They did everything they said they would, our Client Concierge spent time thoroughly explaining the process and continued to follow up throughout the entire process. The agent they aligned us with was just as impressive. Our agent and her team were in constant communication and thoroughly explained their process. They too did everything they said they would. We couldn’t have asked for a better experience. We would highly recommend **[IDEAL AGENT®](https://idealagent.com/)** to anyone who is buying and/or selling a home! Thank you for making this so easy and stress-free!” – Liz from Ohio  
   
“Better than I expected. After seeing the **[IDEAL AGENT®](https://idealagent.com/)** ad on tv, I called just to see what it was all about. Within minutes after talking to my Client Concierge, I received a call from a top local agent. I wasn’t sure I wanted to list my house with a realtor, but my **[IDEAL AGENT®](https://idealagent.com/)** came to my home and did a presentation and walked my home. Had all his facts and figures. He was pleasant, confident, and great to work with. The next day he had my house listed by 11 am and it sold within 24 hours, for the full asking price. His assistant was also a joy to work with. I would recommend the whole experience.” – Deborah from Louisiana  
   
“Smooth transaction. This was the smoothest, simplest, and most trouble-free real estate transaction I've ever been involved in. My dad's house was sold at higher than the listed price and we saved some money on commissions as well. I would not hesitate to recommend **[IDEAL AGENT®](https://idealagent.com/)** to anyone who's looking to sell a home.” – Karl from Iowa
