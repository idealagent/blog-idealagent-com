At IDEAL AGENT®, we understand that building a garage is a significant investment in your property.  Whether you’re enhancing your home for personal enjoyment or preparing it for sale, a garage adds undeniable value. Let's dive into what it costs to build a garage in 2024.

## Why Garages Are Good Investments

A garage does more than shelter your car; it provides additional storage, improves home security, and can boost your property’s value. For savvy homeowners, a well-built garage is an investment that pays dividends in convenience and resale appeal.

**Types of Garages**

Garages come in various forms, from attached to detached and single-car to multi-car. Choosing the right type of garage depends on your specific needs, property size, and budget.

**Attached vs. Detached:** An attached garage is connected to your home, offering convenience and cost savings on materials and labor. A detached garage is separate from the house, which can be a benefit if you’re looking to reduce noise or fumes entering the living space.

## **Single vs. Multi-Car:**

The number of vehicles you wish to accommodate will impact the size and cost of building the garage. Single-car garages are compact, while multi-car garages provide more space for vehicles, a workshop, or extra storage.

|   ### **Type of Garage**   |   ### **Pros**   |   ### **Cons**   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Detached Garage** | \- Easy to add later without construction on the house.   \- Can be used as sheds, workshops, or for storing equipment. | \- May require exposure to unpleasant weather conditions.   \- Less convenient access from the garage to the house.   \- The cost to build a detached garage is usually about 10% to 15% more than you would for an attached garage. This is especially true if you plan to run electricity and plumbing to your detached garage. |
| **Attached Garage** | \- Convenient access to the house, especially in inclement weather.   \- Adds value to the property and saves yard space. | \- Security concerns due to direct access to the home.   \- Difficult to expand or make further additions. |
| **Single-Car Garage** | \- Cost-effective option, especially for smaller properties.   \- Easier to integrate into existing home structures.   \- Can be sufficient for households with one vehicle. | \- Limited storage space for additional vehicles or equipment.   \- Less flexibility for future needs like workspace or storage expansion. |
| **Multi-Car Garage**  | \- Provides ample space for multiple vehicles, bikes, or lawn equipment.   \- Offers flexibility for additional storage, workspace, or recreational use.   \- Can increase property value and appeal. | \- Higher initial construction costs compared to single-car garages.   \- Requires more space on the property, potentially limiting yard area. |
