For Sale By Owner: You've probably seen this phrase on real estate listings, and it might seem quite appealing at first glance. Skipping agent commissions and having full control over the selling process sounds great, right? But there's more to it. Selling your home without an agent can actually reduce the number of potential buyers who see your property, delay the sale, and even expose you to scams or legal issues. Let's chat about why you may want to rethink listing your house for sale by owner, and how choosing the right agent can drastically improve your selling experience. 

## Common Myths About FSBO 

Let’s start by addressing some of the most common myths about listing your home for sale by owner vs realtor or agent-assisted sales. You may read many of these online when searching for "how to sell a house without a realtor or agent," but they're often misleading.  

### **Myth #1: You’ll Make More Money** 

Can you sell a house without a realtor or agent? Sure, but you likely won't make as much.This is a big one – in 2021, homes sold by agents went for an average of [$58,000 more](https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics/quick-real-estate-statistics) than homes for sale by owners! Real estate agents are well-versed in the market and know the sweet spot for your home to earn its maximum potential value. 

### **Myth #2: Listing Your Home FSBO is Free** 

While you may be saving money on real estate commissions, selling a house without a realtor or agent also means losing out on the services they provide. You’ll need to invest in quality photos, staging materials, signage, flyers, and more. So if you're wondering "[Do I need a listing agent,"](https://blog.idealagent.com/do-i-need-listing-agent/) it's important to factor in the time and effort it takes to list the home itself.

###  **Myth #3: Contracts are Simple**

Sure, there may be templates online for real estate contracts. But every home is different, and using the wrong contract for your sale could open you up to _major_ liability issues. Real estate agents are trained on contracts, and many have special insurance that can mitigate any mistakes. Some agents even work with contract lawyers.

#### **Get More Views** 

Real estate agents are marketing experts, and most have already built impressive networks. They can create eye-catching listings through real estate websites like the Multiple Listing Service (MLS)  and promote your home to their other social media followers. The more eyes you reach, the more quickly your home will sell (and the more competitive the offers will be). 

#### **Negotiate Better** 

Negotiations can be a battle – especially with no one to act as a buffer between buyer and seller. Luckily, real estate agents are excellent negotiators. They’re more objective about your home, and they’ll provide all parties with unbiased guidance to reach the best price.
