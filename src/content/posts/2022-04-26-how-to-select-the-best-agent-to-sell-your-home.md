**_Professional Teams:_** There is a great benefit to having an agent that is part of a professional team, one of those is a built-in buyer’s base of clients due to their relationships with buyer’s agents.    
   
**_Yield Offers and Negotiations:_** Our agents will negotiate the best offer on your behalf as well as work with inexperienced buyer’s agents. You can rest assured that they will be right by your side through the entire process.    
   
**_Facilitate Inspections & Coordinate Closing:_** You can expect your agent to coordinate all inspections and walkthroughs as well as navigate bad home inspections and low appraisals.
