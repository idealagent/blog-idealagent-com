Inc. magazine revealed its list of the fastest-growing private companies in the Southeast and several Tampa Bay area companies were on the list. 

The Inc. Regionals award is an extension of the media company's annual Inc. 5000 list, recognizing the fastest-growing private companies in the U.S. To qualify for the regional recognition, companies must pay a fee to apply and have generated at least $100,000 in revenue in 2019 and $1 million in revenue in 2021.

iBuyXS LLC, a St. Petersburg-based software firm specializing in filling electronic shortages, ranked No. 4 overall and is the highest-ranked company in Florida, according to Inc.

Following behind at No. 10 was Ideal Agent, the Tampa-based real estate company, which saw a 2,721 percent growth. Last year, the company ranked No. 1 in the Business Journal's Fast 50 Awards, [honoring the area's fastest-growing private companies](https://www.bizjournals.com/tampabay/news/2022/07/28/tampa-bay-fast-50-ranking-order.html).
