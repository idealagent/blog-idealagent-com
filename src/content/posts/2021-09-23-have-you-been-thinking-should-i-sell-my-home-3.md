If the answer to that question is yes, you aren’t alone, and most importantly, you’ve come to the right place! Many of us have been through it before, and can say with absolute certainty that there comes a time in every homeowner’s life when they start asking themselves that very important question: “is the time right to sell my home?” So, let’s get to the facts, if we are looking at the most recent market analysis released by the HUD the answer would be a resounding, YES! The latest National Housing Market Indicators reported that [sales of existing homes have actually increased](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/sites/default/files/pdf/Housing-Market-Indicators-Report-July-2021.pdf). In fact, a [recent article by Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/mortgages/how-to-get-the-most-when-selling-in-todays-hot-real-estate-market/) explains that “Home sellers have a royal flush in today’s housing marketing. Inventory is low, home prices are rising, and buyer appetite is ravenous.” Need we say more? It’s without a doubt that many homeowners across the United States are taking advantage of the current market to part ways with a property that they have outgrown in one way or another. With that said, we also understand that it comes down to more than just what your neighbors are doing! 

There are many aspects of a home selling process that need to be considered before you are ready to say, “I’m ready to sell my home!” You might be asking yourself what factors other sellers consider before they are ready to take the leap, so we figured we’d cover some of the most common concerns and just how we can help ease those woes! 

Most commonly, sellers become worried that they aren’t fully equipped with the right resources to sell their home themselves or that they wouldn’t get top dollar for their property. These are valid concerns and not having a trusted and top-performing helping hand in the process can seem both daunting and oftentimes, fruitless. In fact, [Forbes also says](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/mortgages/how-to-get-the-most-when-selling-in-todays-hot-real-estate-market/) “Sellers should keep a cool head when it comes to pricing their home…work with your agent to come up with a strong opening price and let the market factors (low inventory, high demand) do the rest.” 

So, who exactly is that agent that will help you get top dollar at the closing table? In our opinion, it is an **[IDEAL AGENT®](https://idealagent.com/)**! 

**Who We Are**

We can all agree that the best agents get the best results and when those agents do it for less, our clients win. **[IDEAL AGENT®](https://idealagent.com/)** was designed to make the home selling process easy! We created **IDEAL AGENT®** and the **SMART SELLER™ System** to provide our clients with a better home selling experience, at a fair commission, that gets them to the closing table maximizing their profits. In fact, we've helped thousands of home sellers get top dollar for their homes and save big on real estate commissions with our [**SMART SELLER™ System**](https://idealagent.com/). 

It’s often misunderstood by sellers that increased profits are solely impacted by a lower commission. This is most certainly NOT the case! In fact, large marketing budgets and years of experience in their markets allow our agents to understand what it takes to provide maximum visibility to their client’s listings. More eyes on the seller’s property will undoubtedly provide the best chance of reaching the ideal buyer willing to pay top dollar.
