Let’s face it, in the digital age, rave reviews are the gold standard for engaging with a company or brand. This includes everything from online purchases, [selling a home](https://idealagent.com/signup/), to finding a local vet, [reviews](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/idealagent.com?b=MTYyOTk4NTYxMTAwMHw2MTI3OWI0YmNjMDA4N2U4ZWY2NWZlODY) are able to provide an organic and honest look into what it’s like to engage with a company and connect you with the best of the best! For that reason alone, it’s easy to see why great reviews hold tremendous weight in the mind of many potential sellers. Selling your home is a big decision for many people and finding the right team to support you and guide you through the process is extremely important. Here’s the good news, our clients are raving about their experiences working with us and our agent partners during their recent home sales. 

For instance, [Mitchell](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/idealagent.com?b=MTYyOTk4NTYxMTAwMHw2MTI3OWI0YmNjMDA4N2U4ZWY2NWZlODY) had nothing but great things to say, in fact, he says it was one of the best decisions he made in the last year! Talk about a stellar review, here’s a little more from Mitchell, “I had no idea how much of a brilliant idea it would be to contact **[IDEAL AGENT®](https://idealagent.com/)** when I first thought about doing it. When I did, Chris, the Client Concierge at [**IDEAL AGENT®**](https://idealagent.com/) put me in contact with a realtor and her team in South Florida, which must be one of the best, if not THE best in that region of the United States!! She was continuously taking care of one problem after another, time after time, after time. The exceptionally diligent efforts on their part resulted in my property being sold in less than two months and above the asking price!! Don't hesitate, give them a call. **One of the best decisions I've made in the last year.**” Talk about an excellent review, our team couldn’t be happier hearing how seamless Mitchell’s recent home sales experience was. 

Another client, [Gary](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/idealagent.com?b=MTYyOTk4NTYxMTAwMHw2MTI3OWI0YmNjMDA4N2U4ZWY2NWZlODY), went so far as to say that he wished every business ran the way we do, writing “Our agent is the consummate real estate professional. He and his team were on point every step of the way. He listed on a Saturday, we sold 4 days later and closed shortly thereafter. He kept us informed all along the way, and we always felt comfortable knowing that ‘he had this.’ **I wish every business ran this way.** He is the model of integrity and professionalism.” It goes without saying that when we read this review, we were so excited to add Gary’s property to our growing list of recent home sales that went above and beyond seller expectations.

Speaking of expectations, [another client](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/idealagent.com?b=MTYyOTk4NTYxMTAwMHw2MTI3OWI0YmNjMDA4N2U4ZWY2NWZlODY) of ours wrote that their matched agent exceeded their expectations! This seller left no stone unturned by writing, “We decided to select Ideal Agent based on their promise of providing top agents at as low as 2% commissions. After a lengthy vetting process of three agents from different companies, one being from Ideal Agent, we selected their agent. Our expectation was that our agent and his group would perform as promised, based on the **[IDEAL AGENT®](https://idealagent.com/)** promise to provide a top agent at a 2% commission (on the sellers’ side). He exceeded our expectations! Not only did he provide the services of a top agent at 2%, but he also negotiated a great commission on the buyer side. Additionally, he marketed our home so that we had 13 offers within 3 days showing, and of those 13, 4 offers we're more than $100,000 above the asking price. Our agent was extremely kind, patient, considerate, and on top of every aspect of the sale of our house during the entire process. My family and I could not be happier with the process and the results provided by our agent and his team. For this reason, we rate IDEAL AGENT® five stars! We would also recommend **[IDEAL AGENT®](https://idealagent.com/)** to anyone who is looking for top agents at 2% commissions.”
