Are you ringing in the new year in the comforts of your own home this year? We don't blame you! We have a few ideas that will make your evening spent at home just as enjoyable as a glamorous night out.Â Â Â 

### **1\. Game Night**

Ring in the new year bonding with friends and family over some good-natured competition! Whether you play card games, [drinking games](https://parade.com/1058758/marynliles/fun-drinking-games/), board games, or even video games, you are destined to have some fun over a friendly tournament. Some crowd favorites that will get the whole crew involved are Spoons, Pictionary, Heads Up!, Catch Phrase or even a hilarious game of Cards Against Humanity. Game on, and good luck!Â

### **2\. Host a Cocktail Contest**

A cocktail contest is one way to put a twist on an adult night-in. All it takes is everyone creating a unique cocktail and collecting votes to see who is the best mixologist in the group! Or, if your drink of choice is bourbon, wine, or beer, do a tasting and pair each bottle with various [kinds of cheeses](https://www.usdairy.com/news-articles/cheese-types-what-you-need-to-know-about-cheese) and nuts.Â Â Â Â Â

### **3\. Make a New Year's Meal**

Skip the expensive dinner and prepare a lucky New Yearâ€™s meal! A special occasion like NYE is the best excuse to eat an elaborate meal. If you want to get creative with your food options, have a potluck so you can enjoy unique dishes made by everyone you're celebrating with at home. Some [lucky New Year dishes](https://www.delish.com/holiday-recipes/new-years/g30319544/new-years-good-luck-foods/) that are said to bring abundance to different areas of your life are pork, cabbage, lentils, beans, ring-shaped cake, and fish!Â Â 

### **4\. Have a Pajama Party**

What better way to spend a cozy evening at home than in your favorite pair of PJs? A pajama party is a perfect excuse to pop some popcorn and grab your favorite candy for a movie marathon. Or if youâ€™re in the mood for some self-care, put on a facemask and have a spa night to prep your skin for the new year!Â Â Â

### **5\. Scrapbook Last Year's Memories**

For some, New Yearâ€™s Eve is an opportunity to reflect on the year past and set goals for the year ahead. If thatâ€™s you, a creative way to relive last yearâ€™s memories could be through scrapbooking all of your favorite captured moments from 2022. One thing youâ€™ll never regret is taking the time to put together a visual snapshot in time to look back at and remember. Plus, scrapbooks often serve as cute coffee table books to add to your living room decor. ðŸ˜‰
